# Dataset Information

This project uses the Fruit Detection dataset from Kaggle, which contains a large collection of images from 6 different fruit classes. The dataset is specifically designed for training and evaluating fruit detection models using YOLOv8 format.

You can access the dataset on Kaggle here: [Fruit Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshaytyagi01/fruit-detection)

## Dataset Overview
- Total Images: 8,479 images.
- Fruit Types: The dataset contains images of the following fruits:
  - Apple
  - Grapes
  - Pineapple
  - Orange
  - Banana
  - Watermelon
- Dataset Split:
  - Train Set: 84% (around 7,129 images)
  - Validation Set: 11% (around 932 images)
  - Test Set: 5% (around 418 images)
- Image Format: JPEG
- Image Resolution: Varies across the dataset.
- Annotation Format: YOLOv8 format, where each image has an associated annotation file containing bounding box coordinates and class IDs.

## Dataset Structure
The dataset is organized as follows:

```

├── README.txt         # General information about the dataset
├── cli.log            # Command line interface log
└── yolov8s.pt         # Pretrained YOLOv8 model file (optional for transfer learning)
```

### Files and Directories
- train: Contains the training images and annotations (YOLOv8 format).
- valid: Contains the validation images and annotations (YOLOv8 format).
- test: Contains the test images and annotations (YOLOv8 format).
- README.txt: A file with general information about the dataset.
- cli.log: Log file with command-line interface information.
- data.yaml: Dataset configuration file that defines the paths to the images and classes.
- yolov8s.pt: A pretrained YOLOv8 model file, which can be used for transfer learning.

## Dataset Features
- Number of Classes: 6 (Apple, Grapes, Pineapple, Orange, Banana, Watermelon)
- Annotations: Each image has a corresponding .txt annotation file (in YOLOv8 format) that defines bounding box coordinates and class IDs for each fruit in the image.

## Data Preprocessing
The following preprocessing steps have been applied to the dataset:
1. Image Resizing: Images are resized to a fixed size (e.g., 640x640) to fit the YOLO model input.
2. Data Augmentation: Various augmentations, such as flipping, rotation, and scaling, were applied to enhance model robustness.
3. Normalization: Image pixel values are normalized for better training convergence.
